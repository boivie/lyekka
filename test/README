Test case numbering.

The test cases are numbered based on what they perform. 
Try to fit your new test case in the series below:

0xxx BASIC FUNCTIONALITY
 These test cases can almost be seen as unit tests as they should test
 only an isolated feature.

1xxx OBJECTS
 Test cases for blobs (10xx), trees (11xx), archives (12xx), manifests
 (13xx) and more. 

2xxx LOW LEVEL COMMANDS
 Commands that are often not used by the end-user and that perform basic
 operations on the objects.

5xxx HIGH LEVEL COMMANDS
 TBD
